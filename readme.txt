== Description ==

Mostly provides overrides and additions to other plugins and themes used by GINF.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `ginf` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Make sure that Enlighter plugin is installed and activated
  * If plugin is inactive, then the functionality will not be present
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the LRS integration from the Network settings
1. Setup cron jobs to be automatically triggered every half an hour. This should
only affect the main site/blog as the books themselves are not involved into
processing of xAPI statements and sending those to the LRS.

=== Cron example ===
*/5 * * * * HTTP_HOST=http://SOME_HOST FULL_PHP_BIN_PATH/php -q FULL_WP_ROOT_PATH/wp-cron.php > /dev/null 2>&1

In this example the Cron job is using CLI for running the registered jobs. The
interval being set is every five minutes (although the jobs themselves are
running on hourly basis). If large volumes of data are expected, then giving the
process more memory than the default value could be beneficial, that could be
achieved by passing the memory_limit=512M to the command.
